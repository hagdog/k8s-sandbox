At this time, version 0.1, the Python-based http server
is not operating properly in a Docker container.

At this time, it makes no sense. The server works when run fromt
the command line and when tested inside the container. But, the
server is not working from the Docker container.

The current guess is that there is something going on with the
Docker network behavior on my Mac laptop. Consider the following data.

# Launching pyserver with python.
python src/pyserver.py 

curl  http://localhost:8088
GET request provided by 71484.

kill -s SIGTERM 71484

# stdout
Server started http://localhost:8088
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Oct/2020 19:35:47] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
SIGTERM received.
Server stopped.

# Launching pyserver in a docker container

curl http://localhost:8088
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

docker exec -it pyserver curl http://localhost:8088
GET request provided by 1.

docker exec -it pyserver curl http://localhost:8088
GET request provided by 1.

# stdout
docker logs -f pyserver
Server started http://localhost:8088
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Oct/2020 19:54:46] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
SIGTERM received.
Server stopped.

As you can see, the http server works fine from within the container.
The port forwarding is not, however, working, i.e. -p 8088:8088

This behavior is seen:
a) in a Docker container run in the Mac environment.
b) In a Docker container run in a Unbuntu 20.04 VM on the Mac using VirtualBox.
